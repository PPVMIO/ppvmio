    <p>End of summer 2019, I find myself leaving my first job after college for a new role and end up with more than a month of free time. I considered traveling but couldn’t find anyone to travel with and couldn’t determine a destination that made sense at the time. Much to my surprise, I found that I had the urge actual code and to build something for myself rather than someone else. </p>
    <p>PPVMIO started from a bunch of photos I’ve been amassing, all taken on Fujifilm 35mm disposable cameras. These would eventually become the "Does he have any friends?" page</a>. Using disposable cameras is, needless to say, quite different when compared to using an iPhone or a DSLR. The limited number of photos on a single camera cause most people to be more careful about what they choose to capture.</p>
    <p>I wanted my photos on 35mm film, cuz it looks artsy or whatever, but I also wanted the freedom to take a photo with minimal regard for time, place, or photos left. I bought disposable cameras in bulk off of Amazon in an attempt to not feel so constrained by a finite amount of shots. I ended up using my nights out for subject matter; the driving idea being, what happens if, when I go out, instead of taking a bunch of shitty photos with my iPhone, I do it with a disposable camera? I found this approach created a sense of spontaneity, I was capturing whimsical moments while still producing appealing and entertaining images.</p>
    <p>I turned this concept into a core principle for this site. I designed the site so that browsing would feel playfully random, borderline volatile, but still provide simple layouts for easy navigation.  When perusing the site, you might have noticed that the images/photos/gifs will randomly change position or entirely new ones will appear. You’ll notice that there are buttons that, under the guise of being interactive tools, just refresh the page inviting new visual content.</p>
    <p>I ened up creating a platform to share my life without being subject to a timeline, an algorithm, number of likes or followers, which, in my opinion, is a refreshing change from traditional social media.</p>
    <p>So to answer the question, what is this? It’s kind of my finsta but also a resume, but also a bunch of ideas all compiled together. It’s like a snapshot of everything in my head or maybe you could equate it to a pop up shop of my life, where there are neat little displays of my thoughts and experiences scattered throughout; the medium being a website. I’m proud of the work I put into this site and I’m really happy with the way it turned out. I hope you can appreciate it.</p>
